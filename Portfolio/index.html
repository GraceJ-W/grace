  <div style="font-size: 18px">
    <p1> I’m a second year at Northwestern University studying Journalism in the Medill School. I’m from Philadelphia but have loved exploring Chicago in my free time. I am the styling director for STITCH, Northwestern’s fashion magazine, as well as writing film reviews for The Daily Northwestern and Dj-ing for WNUR’s rock and jazz shows. I’m also a part of the Northwestern Crew Team. Below is a map of all the places I’ve rowed with NU Crew.</p1>

  <div style="font-size: 18px">
  <p> This map shows the specific routes I have rowed. The routes capture my daily practices on Illinois's Skokie River, spring break practice and national championship (ACRA) rows in Oak Ridge, Tenn., and routes at regattas in Grand Rapids, Mich., Iowa City, Iowa, Indianapolis, Ind. and Farmer City,Ill. </p>

  <div style="font-size: 18px">
  <p2>For as long as I can remember, music has been a driving and structuring passion in my life, both in the classroom and in my extracurricular life. At Northwestern University, I hostboth the Rock and Jazz shows at WNUR, the university’s radio station, incorporating music into my week as a time to appreciate great artistry amidst a rigorous academic calendar. As a DJ, I am involved in all aspects of making the radio programs happen, from on-air broadcasting to creating programming, and operating soundboards. Finally, from a personal standpoint, I am an avid vinyl collector and try to attend concerts in Chicago whenever I can. </p2>

  <h4 style="font-size: 24px;">My Top 100 Songs!</h4>
  <div style="font-size: 18px">
  <p3>Though I’ve eschewed the type of ranking publications like Pitchfork or Rolling Stone typically does, I’ve gathered what are, in my opinion, the 100 best songs.
    I’ve decided to keep the options to “pop music” — which I am classifying as most music that's not jazz, classical or showtunes. </p3>

    <div style="font-size: 18px">
      <p>The attached playlist above of my "Top 100" songs was embedded with a Spotify-made link. To embed an interactive playlist from Spotify, after making a playlist I selected the "Share" option. From there you can select one of two options, "Copy link" or "Embed." The "Embed" option gave me copy-and-paste-able code that I put right into VS Code. Those same steps can be followed any time you want to embed a playlist from Spotify.</p>

  <p>The chart above was made using data from NYC Open Data, New York City's public data website. I exported a data set to a Google Sheet where I then edited out some data I thought was redundant or uneccessary. From there, I exported the Google Sheet into Flourish. There I edited the data's appearence and cleaned up some labels and info to make the viz look better. I then used the generated embed code to copy-and-paste into my portfolio. </p>

That being a bold line to seperate sections at the top, then the section title in 28px font size and bold. After my headers, I include why I've included it, then a slimmer line to indicate a subsection, then a subheader in size 24px, to make it noticeable and differentiable from paragraphs, but not confusable with the main section header. -->

<p6> I’ve always desired to watch and learn more and do deep dives into director's work, as well as understanding different methods for storytelling and plot development with television. In my first year at Northwestern, I secured a press pass to the Chicago International Film Festival and interviewed Oscar-winner, Emerald Fennell, about her film Saltburn. I have since penned more reviews and had the privilege to interview director Tim Mielants earlier this fall during the festival.</p6>
